# End‑to‑End WebLoader RAG (mind-bending edition)

An end‑to‑end Retrieval‑Augmented Generation pipeline that scrapes the web, turns pages into embeddings, stores vectors in DataStax AstraDB via Cassio, and performs retrieval + generation with Groq through LangChain. This README skips setup steps and focuses on the idea, architecture, and provocative questions to spark exploration.

---

## What this repo *actually* builds
A production‑ready RAG pipeline that:
- Scrapes and normalizes web content (WebBaseLoader + BeautifulSoup)
- Splits into semantically meaningful chunks
- Generates embeddings (Hugging Face / sentence‑transformers or BGE)
- Persists vectors in AstraDB (Cassandra) via Cassio for scalable vector search
- Retrieves relevant chunks and synthesizes answers with Groq LLMs via LangChain

---

## Questions that should trigger curiosity (and blow your mind)
- What if your search engine could answer why — not just what — by tracing supporting evidence across hundreds of web pages?  
- How small a model can you use while still reliably surfacing the single paragraph that proves a claim?  
- If you index the web as vectors in AstraDB, how fast and consistent can multi‑region retrieval become?  
- Can Groq LLMs be constrained to "cite only these snippets" and produce provable, auditable answers for compliance?  
- What new apps emerge when retrieval latency drops to milliseconds at global scale?

## Key design decisions & tradeoffs
- Persistence in AstraDB: durability and geo distribution vs. management overhead.  
- Embeddings in DB: enables incremental updates and scalable retrieval; costs depend on embedding size.  
- Retriever + LLM separation: keeps model stateless, lets you swap LLMs or retrieval strategies independently.  
- Notebook + modular code: fast experimentation, but move critical paths into services for production.

## Files of interest
- groq.ipynb — end‑to‑end notebook (scrape → embed → store → query)  
- requirements.txt — dependencies snapshot  
- .gitignore — excludes envs, secrets, model files

---

## Security note (non‑negotiable)
- Never commit tokens or private keys. If a secret is committed, rotate it immediately and purge history (git‑filter‑repo / BFG). Use `.env` and CI secrets.

---

## Inspiration prompts (try these after you run the pipeline)
- "Explain Chain of Thought and cite the three most relevant paragraphs across indexed pages."  
- "Compare the paper's stated method with a 1‑sentence summary from an expert blog; provide supporting quotes."  
- "Find contradictions across sources about X and list the exact sentences that disagree."
